# 🚀 Streamlit Machine Learning App in Docker

This project demonstrates how to **deploy a Machine Learning model** using **Streamlit** inside a **Docker container**.  
It allows users to make predictions through a simple web interface.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- Install [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- Install necessary Python packages (`streamlit`, `scikit-learn`, `pickle`)

---

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- `model.pkl` → Pre-trained Machine Learning model saved using pickle.
- `app.py` → Streamlit web app that loads the model and makes predictions.
- `Dockerfile` → Instructions to build the Docker image.
- `requirements.txt` → Python dependencies needed for the app.

## 📄 How to Run the Project

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kuwar1269/docker_project.git
cd docker_project/3.StreamlitModel_Docker
2. Build Docker Image
bash
Copy code
docker build -t streamlit-ml-app .
3. Run Docker Container
bash
Copy code
docker run -p 8501:8501 streamlit-ml-app
4. Access the App
Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501.

📸 Features
Loads a pre-trained ML model.

Provides a user-friendly Streamlit interface for input and predictions.

Fully containerized using Docker for easy deployment.
